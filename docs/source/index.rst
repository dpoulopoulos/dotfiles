Welcome to Dotfiles's documentation!
====================================

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! Here, you'll find my collection of configuration files
for various tools and applications that I use on a daily basis. These dotfiles are tailored to
streamline my development environment and enhance productivity across Unix-based systems.

Overview
--------

Dotfiles are used to customize your system's environment. This repository serves as a central hub
to store, manage, and share my configurations for applications such as the shell (bash), editors
(Vim/Neovim), and many others. Whether you're looking to adopt some of my configurations or just
curious about different ways to optimize your development environment, feel free to explore and
borrow whatever you find useful.

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§ This is Work-in-Progress. ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§
