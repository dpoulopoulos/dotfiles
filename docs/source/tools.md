# <i class="fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench"></i> Tools

The configuration files in this repository link to a few tools that can help you get the most out of
your system. Although they are optional, they can make your life easier and more productive.

Here's a list of the tools that are used by the configuration files in this repository:

- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat clone with wings.
- [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck): Magnificent app which corrects your previous console
  command.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): A command-line fuzzy finder.
- [fzf-git.sh](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-git.sh): `bash` and `zsh` key bindings for Git
  objects, powered by fzf.
- [keychain](https://github.com/funtoo/keychain): Helps you to manage ssh and GPG keys in a
  convenient and secure manner

For the best experience, I recommend installing these tools as well.
