# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! Here, you'll find my collection of
configuration files for various tools and applications that I use on a daily
basis. These dotfiles are tailored to streamline my development environment and
enhance productivity across Unix-based systems.

## Overview

Dotfiles are used to customize your system's environment. This repository
serves as a central hub to store, manage, and share my configurations for
applications such as the shell (bash), editors (Vim/Neovim), and many others.
Whether you're looking to adopt some of my configurations or just curious about
different ways to optimize your development environment, feel free to explore
and borrow whatever you find useful.

## Installation

> Warning: If you decide to use my dotfiles, please review the code and remove
> things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know
> what that entails. Use at your own risk!

To install the dotfiles in this repository follow the steps in the
